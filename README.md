# Mental-Health-Support-Chatbot-RAG-

<br>
Developed a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Llama, and SentenceTransformerEmbeddings to deliver mental health support. This chatbot processes information from a PDF knowledge base, allowing it to provide accurate responses on topics like coping mechanisms, self-care practices, and crisis hotline resources. By leveraging machine learning, the chatbot can offer personalized responses, enhancing user engagement and accessibility to mental health resources. This project demonstrates skills in AI, natural language processing, and machine learning, creating a tool that addresses mental health needs with empathy and precision.
